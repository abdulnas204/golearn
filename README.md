# GoLearn

## About
I worked on this during my final-year project.

## Problem
I realised that although my university had deployed [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) as the official learning management system for the whole school, 95% of the students that used the system were from the computer science department. This was obviously not ideal. I set out to find out why the learning management system was being underutilised by students. One of the problems that I observed was that the school's learning management system was mobile unfriendly. My quantitative showed me that students made substantial use of educational apps on their mobile phones.

## Solution
The solution was a mobile app that allows students to form groups within which course material could be accessed and shared. Also, seeing that students were sometimes resistant to downloading course materials with their data plans because of the high cost of internet in Nigeria, I built in a feature which allows students to share course materials without an internet connection.

## Features
+ Creating class groups  👪👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
+ Course explorer  📙
+ Offline file-sharing  📴
+ Synced class timetable  ⏲️

## Visual and UX design
You can find documentation related to the visual design and ux design of the app from page 65 of the [project report](./assets/final-year-project-report.pdf).
