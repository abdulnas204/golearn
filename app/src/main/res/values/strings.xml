    <string name="sample_passage">These two factors, the altitude and the weather, tend separately and together to defeat the climber. The height weakens, slows him down, it forces him to spend days and night in the course of his assault on the summit; the weather, besides adding to the demands of his energy and moral fortitude, conspires to deny him thetime he needs to complete his mission. Whereas in lower mountains and on easy ground the weather may be no more than a handicap, in the high Himalayas it is decisive, regardless of terrain. \nThe deduction to be drawn from these two factors was clear enough. We must either so fortify ourselves that we could continue, without detriment, to live our being above limit of natural acclimatization, or better still, we must solve the problem of speed. It was desirable, in fact that we should meet both these requirements and thus give to these chosen to attempt the summit and to their supporting teams some measure of ignorance against the vagaries of the weather, for safety in mountain climbing is as much a matter of swiftness as of sureness of foot. Either or both could be achieved only by the administration of oxygen in sufficient quantities to make up for the deficiency in the air, and for the duration of the upward journey above limit of successful acclimatization.</string>
